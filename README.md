## Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using the White Shark Optimizer Algorithm

This code repository introduces an innovative solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the White Shark Optimizer (WSO), a swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of white sharks.

### Features
- **Cities as Particles**: Each TSP city is modeled as a particle within the WSO framework, enhancing the search for the shortest path.
- **Customized Velocity Update**: Incorporates a unique velocity function reflecting shark swimming patterns for improved solution space exploration.
- **MATLAB Implementation**: The WSO algorithm is implemented and tested in MATLAB, leveraging its advanced computational features.

### Outcomes
The modified WSO algorithm has been proven to outperform traditional TSP solvers, achieving high-quality solutions with efficient computation times.

### Contributions
Researchers and enthusiasts are welcome to explore, test, and contribute to the application of WSO in this and other optimization problems.

### Getting Started
Refer to the provided documentation and instructions in the repository to begin experimenting with the WSO algorithm.
